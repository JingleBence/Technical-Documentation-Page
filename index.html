    <header>What is CSS?</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.
      </p>
      In the Introduction to HTML module we covered what HTML is, and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing is the browser's default styles — very basic styles that the browser applies to HTML to make sure it will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.

      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>
          However, the web would be a boring place if all websites looked like that. Using CSS you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.

    <header>CSS syntax</header>
    <article>
      <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."</p>
      <p>The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>

      <code>
        h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}
      </code>
      <p>The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings.</p>
      <p>Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.</p>
      
      A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.
      <code>h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

p {
    color: black;
}</code>
      <p>You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when you forget, or want to know what else you can use as a value.</p>

      <p>
        As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and other features it contains. You will also find links to the CSS Specification that defines the technology (see below).
      </p>

      <p>
       At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar things and are therefore probably in the same specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that it makes logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this module. And you'd be right.
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
    <header>CSS Specifications</header>
    
    <p>All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.

CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. This group is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS. There are also other people, known as invited experts, who act as independent voices; they are not linked to a member organization.</p>
    
    <p>New CSS features are developed, or specified, by the CSS Working Group. Sometimes because a particular browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers and developers are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a requirement. CSS is constantly developing, with new features becoming available. However, a key thing about CSS is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break old websites. A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS available then, should still be usable in a browser today!</p>
    
    <p>As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs overwhelming — they are intended for engineers to use to implement support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to read to understand CSS. Many experienced developers would much rather refer to MDN documentation or other tutorials. It is however worth knowing that they exist, understanding the relationship between the CSS you are using, browser support (see below), and the specs.</p>

    <header>Applying CSS to HTML</header>
    <h4>External stylesheet</h4>
    <p>
      First, let's examine three methods of applying CSS to a document: with an external stylesheet, with an internal stylesheet, and with inline styles.

External stylesheet
An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we linked an external stylesheet to our web page.
    </p>
    
    <article>
      You reference an external CSS stylesheet from an HTML  element:
    </article>
    <xmp>
      <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My CSS experiment</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first CSS example</p>
  </body>
</html>
</xmp>
    <p>The CSS stylesheet file might look like this:</p>
    <code>h1 {
  color: blue;
  background-color: yellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

p {
  color: red;
}</code>
    
    <p>The href attribute of the <link> element needs to reference a file on your file system. In the example above, the CSS file is in the same folder as the HTML document, but you could place it somewhere else and adjust the path. Here are three examples:</p>
    
    <xmp>
      <!-- Inside a subdirectory called styles inside the current directory -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">

<!-- Inside a subdirectory called general, which is in a subdirectory called styles, inside the current directory -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/general/style.css">

<!-- Go up one directory level, then inside a subdirectory called styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles/style.css">
    </xmp>
    <h4>Internal stylesheet</h4>
    
    <p>
      An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a  style element contained inside the HTML head.
    </p>
      
      <p>The HTML for an internal stylesheet might look like this:</p>
      <xmp>
      <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My CSS experiment</title>
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: blue;
        background-color: yellow;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }

      p {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first CSS example</p>
  </body>
</html>
      </xmp>
    
    <p>In some circumstances, internal stylesheets can be useful. For example, perhaps you're working with a content management system where you are blocked from modifying external CSS files.
    </p>
    
    <p>But for sites with more than one page, an internal stylesheet becomes a less efficient way of working. To apply uniform CSS styling to multiple pages using internal stylesheets, you must have an internal stylesheet in every web page that will use the styling. The efficiency penalty carries over to site maintenance too. With CSS in internal stylesheets, there is the risk that even one simple styling change may require edits to multiple web pages.</p>
    
    <h4>
      Inline styles
    </h4>
    
    <p>Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute. The implementation of an inline style in an HTML document might look like this:</p>
    
    <xmp>
      <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My CSS experiment</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 style="color: blue;background-color: yellow;border: 1px solid black;">Hello World!</h1>
    <p style="color:red;">This is my first CSS example</p>
  </body>
</html>
    </xmp>
    
    <p>Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible. It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.</p>
    
    <p>There are a few circumstances where inline styles are more common. You might have to resort to using inline styles if your working environment is very restrictive. For example, perhaps your CMS only allows you to edit the HTML body. You may also see a lot of inline styles in HTML email to achieve compatibility with as many email clients as possible.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
    <header>Adding CSS to our document</header>
    <p>
      The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the head of the HTML document:
    </p>
    
    <xmp>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </xmp>
    
    <p>
      This <b>link</b> element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code editor add the following to your CSS file:
    </p>
    
    <xmp>
      h1 {
  color: red;
}
    </xmp>
    
    <p>
      Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.
    </p>
    
    <p>      
You can continue to work in styles.css locally, or you can use our interactive editor below to continue with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.
    </p>
      
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
    <header>Styling HTML elementse</header>
    
    <p>
      By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs green you would use:
    </p>
    
    <code>
      p {
  color: green;
}
    </code>
    
    <p>You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma. If I want all paragraphs and all list items to be green my rule looks like this:</p>
    
    <code>
      p, li {
    color: green;
}
    </code>
    
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
    <header>Changing the default behavior of elements</header>
    
    <p>When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as simple as our example, we can see how the browser is making the HTML readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large and bold and our list has bullets. This happens because browsers have internal stylesheets containing default styles, which they apply to all pages by default; without them all of the text would run together in a clump and we would have to style everything from scratch. All modern browsers display HTML content by default in pretty much the same way.</p>
    
    <p>
      However, you will often want something other than the choice the browser has made. This can be done by choosing the HTML element that you want to change, and using a CSS rule to change the way it looks. A good example is our <ul>, an unordered list. It has list bullets, and if I decide I don't want those bullets I can remove them like so:
    </p>
    
    <code>
      li {
  list-style-type: none;
}
    </code>
    <p>Try adding this to your CSS now.</p>
    
    <p>The list-style-type property is a good property to look at on MDN to see which values are supported. Take a look at the page for list-style-type and you will find an interactive example at the top of the page to try some different values in, then all allowable values are detailed further down the page.</p>
    
    <p>Looking at that page you will discover that in addition to removing the list bullets you can change them — try changing them to square bullets by using a value of square.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
    <header>Adding a class</header>
    
    <p>So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case and so you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without changing the others. The most common way to do this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.</p>
    
    <p>In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like this:</p>
    
    <xmp>
      <ul>
  <li>Item one</li>
  <li class="special">Item two</li>
  <li>Item <em>three</em></li>
</ul>
    </xmp>
    
    <p>In your CSS you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop character. Add the following to your CSS file:</p>
    
    <code>
      .special {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}
    </code>
    
    <p>Save and refresh to see what the result is.</p>
    
    <p>You can apply the class of special to any element on your page that you want to have the same look as this list item. For example, you might want the <span> in the paragraph to also be orange and bold. Try adding a class of special to it, then reload your page and see what happens.</p>
      
      <p>Sometimes you will see rules with a selector that lists the HTML element selector along with the class:</p>
    
    <code>
      li.special {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}
    </code>
    
    <p>This syntax means "target any li element that has a class of special". If you were to do this then you would no longer be able to apply the class to a <span> or another element by adding the class to it; you would have to add that element to the list of selectors:</p>
      
      <code>
        li.special,
span.special {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}
      </code>
      
      <p>As you can imagine, some classes might be applied to many elements and you don't want to have to keep editing your CSS every time something new needs to take on that style. Therefore it is sometimes best to bypass the element and refer to the class, unless you know that you want to create some special rules for one element alone, and perhaps want to make sure they are not applied to other things.</p>
